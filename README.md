# Dylan's Website

To view the website locally, open a terminal and navigate to the project directory. Then start a simple python server and keep it running in the background. For example:

    cd ~/dylanhendersonj.github.io
    python3 -m http.server

You can then view the website at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).
