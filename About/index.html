    Dylan is a Brooklyn based multimedia filmmaker. He uses the processes of stop-motion animation and narrative fictional storytelling to explore and engage with abstract concepts--such as the formation of personality--in an attempt to reify them into film experiences people can share. 
    
    <p>Dylan attended Emerson College in Boston and graduated with a B.A. in Film Production.</p>
